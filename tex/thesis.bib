	ABSTRACT = "We present a new image-based technique to rigidly register intraoperative three-dimensional ultrasound (US) with preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) images. Automatic registration is achieved by maximization of a similarity measure which generalizes the correlation ratio, and whose novelty is to incorporate multivariate information from the MR data (intensity and gradient). In addition, the similarity measure is built upon a robust intensity-based distance measure, which makes it possible to handle a variety of US artifacts. A cross-validation study has been carried out using a number of phantom and clinical data. This indicates that the method is quite robust and that the worst registration errors are of the order of the MR image resolution."

The approximation scheme is based on the fact that a parametric 3-surface can locally be approximated by the graph of a trivariate function. Using a local coordinate system, at lest square polynomial approximation is constructed for the estimation of the principal curvature at each 3-surface point. Curvature is extremely useful for the analysis of qualitative characteristics of surfaces. The technique presented is an example of extending existing surface interrogation methods to multivariate data. Such a generalization is valuble for scientific visualization."

We demonstrate that it leads to strong theoretical properties: the cone of positive definite symmetric matrices is replaced by a regular and complete manifold without boundaries (null eigenvalues are at the infinity), the geodesic between two tensors and the mean of a set of tensors are uniquely defined, etc. We have previously shown that the Riemannian metric provides a powerful framework for generalizing statistics to manifolds. In this paper, we show that it is also possible to generalize to tensor fields many important geometric data processing algorithms such as interpolation, filtering, diffusion and restoration of missing data. For instance, most interpolation and Gaussian filtering schemes can be tackled efficiently through a weighted mean computation. Linear and anisotropic diffusion schemes can be adapted to our Riemannian framework, through partial differential evolution equations, provided that the metric of the tensor space is taken into account. For that purpose, we provide intrinsic numerical schemes to compute the gradient and Laplace-Beltrami operators. Finally, to enforce the fidelity to the data (either sparsely distributed tensors or complete tensors fields) we propose least-squares criteria based on our invariant Riemannian distance which are particularly simple and efficient to solve."

	ABSTRACT = "The problem of increasing the slice resolution of functional MRI (fMRI) images without a loss in signal-to-noise ratio is considered. In standard fMRI experiments, increasing the slice resolution by a certain factor decreases the signal-to-noise ratio of the images with the same factor. For this purpose an adapted EPI MRI acquisition protocol is proposed, allowing one to acquire slice-shifted images from which one can generate interpolated super-resolution images, with an increased resolution in the slice direction. To solve the problem of correctness and robustness of the created super-resolution images from these slice-shifted datasets, the use of discontinuity preserving regularization methods is proposed. Tests on real morphological, synthetic functional, and real functional MR datasets have been performed, by comparing the obtained super-resolution datasets with high-resolution reference datasets. In the morphological experiments the image spatial resolution of the different types of images are compared. In the synthetic and real fMRI experiments, on the other hand, the quality of the different datasets is studied as function of their resulting activation maps. From the results obtained in this study, we conclude that the proposed super-resolution techniques can both improve the signal-to-noise ratio and augment the detectability of small activated areas in fMRI image sets acquired with thicker slices.",

	abstract = "The relations between end-diastolic (D) and end-systolic (S) fiber angles ({alpha}) and sarcomere lengths (s) have been previously studied at different sites in canine left ventricular myocardium. However, no postulates have been advanced for predicting a and s in successive states of the ejection cycle (D or S) or at different sites in one state when the semimajor (Z) and semiminor (R) axes of the wall surfaces for successive states and the fiber orientations and sarcomere lengths at one site in one state are known. In this study, the myocardial fibers were regarded as the matrix of a myocardial continuum: they are prisoners of the heart wall and must comply with the movements of the wall. Using the same values as in the preceding article, the wall was treated as a nested set of truncated ellipsoidal shells of revolution with shell volumes preserved from D to S. Both confocal and nonconfocal configurations were analyzed. In each shell, the fibers were assumed to follow a ``helical'' path with a constant advance in each turn about the Z axis (the simplest possible path). The results of this assumption were compatible with previously reported values of a and s measured at various sites in the left ventricular free wall in states D and S. These results suggest a postulate for the heart wall: in the beating heart, each muscle fiber changes direction and length uniquely as the wall changes shape. ",

	abstract = "OBJECTIVES: It has been proposed that successful left ventricular surgical restoration should restore normal helical myofiber orientation. A magnetic resonance imaging technique, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging, has been developed to measure myocyte orientation. By using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging, this study tested the hypothesis that (1) myocyte orientation is altered after anteroapical myocardial infarction and (2) left ventricular surgical restoration restores normal helix angles. METHODS: Thirteen sheep underwent anteroapical myocardial infarction (25% of left ventricular mass). Ten weeks later, animals underwent either aneurysm plication (n = 8) or sham operations (n = 5). Six weeks after this operation, hearts were excised, perfusion fixed in diastole, and underwent magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging. Hearts from normal sheep (n = 5) were also harvested and imaged. Primary eigenvectors of the diffusion tensors from magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging were resolved into helix angles relative to a local wall coordinate system. Transmural samples of the helix angles were compared at the border zone of the aneurysm or repair (or a comparable distance from the base in normal sheep), 1 cm below the valves, and halfway between. RESULTS: The helical myofiber orientation did not change after myocardial infarction. However, aneurysm plication caused myofibers in the anterior border zone to rotate counterclockwise (-35.6 {+/-} 10.5{degrees}, P = .028) and those in the lateral border zone to rotate clockwise (34.4 {+/-} 8.1{degrees}, P = .031). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical restoration alters myocyte orientation adjacent to the surgical repair. However, myofiber orientation is not abnormal after myocardial infarction, and thus surgical restoration techniques intent on restoring normal helix angles might not be warranted. ",

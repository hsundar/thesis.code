  abstract = "An adaptive mesh projection method for the time-dependent incompressible Euler equations is presented. The domain is spatially discretised using quad/octrees and a multilevel Poisson solver is used to obtain the pressure. Complex solid boundaries are represented using a volume-of-fluid approach. Second-order convergence in space and time is demonstrated on regular, statically and dynamically refined grids. The quad/octree discretisation proves to be very flexible and allows accurate and efficient tracking of flow features. The source code of the method implementation is freely available.",
